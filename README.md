# About  
© Networker is a console app designed to help users better network with others. It allows users sign up and sign in using their credentials, create profiles for themselves, search for other users and view their profiles, send them friend requests, stay connected and sent text messages. The app also allows them to post job postings for which other users can apply or/and save. When they do apply, the poster users would be notified and be able to get the listing of all applications, review them, get applicant user information and either approve or reject applications. Additionally, users would be able to post anything they want for any topic, similar to tweets, and other users would be able to post comments and either like or dislike them. An futher feature is the addition of notifications for new job postings and new friend requests - whenever a user sends a friend request or posts a new job posting in the area of interest of another user, that user would receive an automated email with the details.

# Technical Information
© Networker is a console application built in Python programming language (Python 3.9). For the backend data storage, it uses Firebase with the Pyrebase package.
